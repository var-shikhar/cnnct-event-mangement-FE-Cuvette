# CNNCT - Easy Scheduling Ahead

## Overview

CNNCT simplifies scheduling for you and your team by eliminating the back-and-forth of setting up meetings. Set your availability, share your link, and let others book time with you instantly.

## Features

### Event Creation & Participation

- Participants can accept or reject the invitation.

### Availability Management
